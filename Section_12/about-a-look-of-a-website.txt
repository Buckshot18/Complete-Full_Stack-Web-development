This is the old website of penny juice where people would pay maybe $1 for a 
juice box.

This is a newer reworked website that looks better on the eye and people 
dont mind to pay $3 or $4 for a juice box.

Colour can have a meaning which is why red for instance is meant for love care or anything with a deep felling
and maybe royal blue means rich, money, expensive.

12.2 Typography
Choosing font more aggressive font wont work for a baby product website but 
rather for a scary movie trailer

12.3 User interface design
A good layout keeps readers eyes locked in if tis comfortable if for instance 
it was in a very small box where 400 characters is sqeuzed in people will not read it

alignment of text, pictures or box content alignments also helps with a good 
layout if you have 2 column views and everything is alligned center text will 
look all over the place and will make it hard to keep track of where as you can 
rather align them from left to right keeping content more in their own column 
starting to read from the left.

12.4 User Experience design
What is UX
user Experience is how a user finds to move around on a website for example if you have 3 pages and on every page the search button is on a different place that is a bad user experience.
Is it easy to read and find what youre looking for or do they need to take a minute to find a topping in a bloated page of content.
Also UX is not limited for only desktop web developers they need to keep in mind to make it functional on any size device.
