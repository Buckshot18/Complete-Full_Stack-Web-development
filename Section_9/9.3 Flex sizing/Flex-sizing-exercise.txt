Fix the blue box sizing the same as the green box must also adapt to window size

My outcome in ---> image.png

.container {
display: flex;
turns the ,container into a flex container allowing its children to be 
laid in a row

justify-content: space-between; Puts space between the children evenly
}

.item1 {
    max-width: 200px;
    the box can grow but not larger than 200px
    flex: 1 1 0;  short for
    flex-grow; 1; Can grow in available space
    flex-shrink: 1; Can shrink when needed
    flex-basis: 0; Starts with 0 width before growing
All this means the .item class can shrink with the min length of the 
largest word and can grow but it is capped at 200 px
}

.item2 {
    is on a fixed width of 200px and cannot grow or shrink
}

.item3 {
    is also in a fixed position of 400px and cannot grow or shrink
}
